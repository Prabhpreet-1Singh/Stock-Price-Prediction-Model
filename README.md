Stock Price Analysis using Regression, Regularization, and Support Vector Machine
This project is focused on predicting the closing stock price of a given stock using machine learning concepts like regression, regularization, and support vector machine. The data for this project is downloaded from Yahoo Finance using the yfinance library.

Getting Started
To get started with the project, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

numpy
pandas
yfinance
seaborn
matplotlib
You can install them via pip:

Copy code
pip install numpy pandas yfinance seaborn matplotlib
Usage
The project uses a Jupyter Notebook to run the code. The notebook file Stock Price Analysis.ipynb contains the code to run the analysis.

Open the Stock Price Analysis.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook.
Run the code cells to execute the analysis.
Enter the stock code when prompted to see the analysis for the desired stock.
Data
The data used in this project is downloaded from Yahoo Finance using the yfinance library. The data contains the following columns:

Open: opening stock price
High: highest stock price of the day
Low: lowest stock price of the day
Close: closing stock price
Volume: number of shares traded on the given day
Analysis
The analysis involves predicting the closing price of the stock using regression, regularization, and support vector machine. The code performs the following tasks:

Downloads the stock data from Yahoo Finance using the yfinance library.
Cleans and preprocesses the data.
Plots the distribution of the stock prices using seaborn and matplotlib.
Splits the data into training and testing sets.
Applies regression, regularization, and support vector machine to predict the closing price of the stock.
Evaluates the accuracy of the model using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R-squared.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of machine learning algorithms to predict the closing price of a given stock. The model's accuracy can be improved by tweaking the parameters of the algorithms and by using more advanced techniques like deep learning.
